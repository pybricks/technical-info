# LEGO Powered Up UART Protocol

The LEGO Powered Up UART sensor protocol seems to be based on the EV3 UART
sensor protocol with some new extensions. Information on this page can be assumed
to apply to both EV3 UART sensors and Powered Up UART devices unless it is
explicitly stated otherwise.

Note: Identifier names used here come from [lms2012.h][1] and [d_uart_mod.c][2].
Other names are inspired by [LWP3][3]. Some new identifier names are invented.
Identifiers currently used by Pybricks are available from [lump.h][4].

Conventions: In the format specifiers below, `[]` means that the enclosed content
is optional and `<>` means that the content is variable and should be replaced
with a suitable value.

## UART Device Synchronization

When a sensor is powered on, it will start sending data at 2400 baud. The data
being contains information about the device and its modes of operation. This
sequence is sent repeatedly until the device receives an ACK from the programmable
brick it is connected to.

The programmable brick watches for `CMD_TYPE`, which is always the first message
in the sequence of data. Once this message has been identified, then the brick
can decode the remaining messages in the sequence.

The sequence starts with `MESSAGE_CMD` messages that give information about the
device followed by `MESSAGE_INFO` commands that give information about each mode.
The last mode in the sequence is considered the default mode. In practice, the
modes are enumerated from highest to lowest (0 always being the lowest).

The sequence sent by the device is terminated by `BYTE_ACK` and `BYTE_SYNC`. If
the there were no errors reading any of the messages,the brick will reply with
`BYTE_ACK`. Both devices will then change baud rates (the actual rate is
contained in one of the messages) and the device will start sending sensor data
to the brick. The brick sends `BYTE_NACK` every 100 milliseconds to let the
device know it is still there. If the device does not receive `BYTE_NACK`, it
will reset and go back to sending the informational messages at 2400 baud.

Newer LPF2 I/O devices can send information messages at 115200 baud instead of
2400 baud. A `CMD_SPEED` message with the baud rate (115200) must be sent to
the I/O device before it starts transmitting information messages. If the I/O
device supports this feature, it will reply with a `BYTE_ACK` message. If no
`BYTE_ACK` is received, then it is assumed the feature is not supported and it
is expected that the information messages will be received at 2400 baud.


## Message Format

The general message format is `HEADER [DATA [...]] CHECKSUM`. That is, a one-byte
header, followed by 0 to 32 data bytes and concluding with a checksum.

Bits 7-6 of the header are the message type. Bits 5-3 of the header are the
message size and bits 2-0 are the command or mode depending on the message type.

The checksum is computed by XORing `0xff` with each byte of the message.

### System Messages

System messages (`MESSAGE_SYS`) are a single byte and don't include a checksum.
As mentioned above `BYTE_ACK` and `BYTE_SYNC` are sent at the end of the device
information sequence. `BYTE_NACK` is sent to the device after synchronization
at a regular interval (100 milliseconds) to prevent the device from resetting.

Note: The LEGO EV3 Infrared sensor appears to send a checksum (`0xff`) after
`BYTE_SYNC`.

### Command Messages

Command messages (`MESSAGE_CMD`) part of the device information sequence
received from the device with the exception of `CMD_SELECT` and `CMD_WRITE`
which are used to control the device (sent from brick to device).

#### CMD_TYPE

`CMD_TYPE` tells the brick what type of device this is. This command is required
and must be the first command in the sequence sent by a device.

The message is formatted as follows::

    MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_1 | CMD_TYPE, <type-id>, <checksum>

The values for (`<type-id>`) can be found in the [Assigned Numbers](./assigned-numbers.md)
document.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x40, 0x25, 0x9a
      ^     ^     ^
      |     |     checksum
      |     type ID 37
      MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_1 | CMD_TYPE

#### CMD_MODES

`CMD_MODES` tells the brick how many modes this device has. This message is
required.

The message is formatted as follows::

    MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_<n> | CMD_MODES, <modes>, [<views>, [<modes2>, <views2>,]] <checksum>

`<modes>` is the total number of modes minus one (limited to a max value of 7).
`<views>` is the number of modes (also minus one) that can be used in Port View
or Data Logger (limited to a max value of 7). If `<views>` is not provided, it
is implied that it has the same value as `<modes>`. `<modes2>` and `<views2`> are
only provided by Powered Up devices. These are the same values, but are limited
to a max value of 15 instead of 7). `<n>` is 1, 2 or 4 depending on how many
values are provided.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x51, 0x07, 0x07, 0x0a, 0x07, 0xa3
      ^     ^     ^     ^     ^     ^
      |     |     |     |     |     checksum
      |     |     |     |     8 views
      |     |     |     11 modes
      |     |     8 views (for EV3)
      |     8 modes (for EV3)
      MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_4 | CMD_MODES

Example, LEGO EV3 Color sensor:

    0x49, 0x05, 0x02, 0xb1
      ^     ^     ^     ^
      |     |     |     checksum
      |     |     3 views
      |     6 modes
      MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_2 | CMD_MODES

#### CMD_SPEED

`CMD_SPEED` tells the brick the baud rate to use after synchronizing. This
message is optional. If omitted, it is implied that the device will remain at
2400 baud. In practice, this message is always provided.

The message is formatted as follows::

    MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_4 | CMD_SPEED, <speed>, <checksum>

`<speed>` is a 32-bit little-endian integer value.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x52, 0x00, 0xc2, 0x01, 0x00, 0x6e
      ^     ^_________________^     ^
      |     |                       checksum
      |     |
      |     speed = 115200
      MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_4 | CMD_SPEED

#### CMD_SELECT

`CMD_SELECT` is used to set the mode of the device.

The message is formatted as follows::

    MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_1 | CMD_SELECT, <mode>, <checksum>

`<mode>` is the mode.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x43, 0x02, 0xbe
      ^     ^     ^
      |     |     checksum
      |     mode = 2 ("COUNT")
      MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_1 | CMD_SELECT

#### CMD_WRITE

`CMD_WRITE` writes arbitrary data to the sensor.

The message is formatted as follows::

    MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_<n> | CMD_WRITE, <data>, <checksum>

`<data>` is `<n>` bytes of device-specific data.

Example, LEGO EV3 Gyro sensor:

    0x44, 0x17, 0xac
      ^     ^     ^
      |     |     checksum
      |     reset command
      MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_1 | CMD_WRITE

Note: the value for the reset command comes from EV3-G software. Not sure if it
actually does anything.

#### CMD_VERSION

`CMD_VERSION` receives the firmware version and hardware version of the device.
This message is optional. It is not present on EV3 sensors.

The message is formatted as follows::

    MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_8 | CMD_VERSION, <fw-version>, <hw-version>, <checksum>

`<fw-version>` and `<hw-version>` are 32-bit little-endian BCD values
representing the firmware and hardware versions of a device, respectively. Each
The MSB contains the major and minor revision values. The next byte
contains the bug fix revision and the two LSBs contain the build number.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x5f, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x10, 0xa0
      ^     ^_________________^     ^_________________^     ^
      |     |                       |                       checksum
      |     |                       hw-version = 1.0.00.0000
      |     fw-version = 1.0.00.0000
      MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_8 | CMD_VERSION

### Mode Information Messages

Mode information messages (`MESSAGE_INFO`) contain information about a specific
device mode.

#### INFO_NAME

`INFO_NAME` gives the name of the mode. This is limited to 11 characters (not
including null termination). This message is required.

This message is formatted as follows:

    MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_<n> | MODE_<m>, INFO_NAME [| INFO_MODE_PLUS_8], <name>, <checksum>

`<name>` is the device name encoded using ASCII characters. The length `<n>`
must be a power of 2, so unused data bytes should be set to `0x00`. The data
does not need to include a null terminator, e.g. if the name is 4 characters,
the length can be set to 4.

The mode `<m>` is limited to 7. If the mode is greater than 7, `INFO_MODE_PLUS_8`
must be set in the second byte of the message and `<m>` must be set to the mode
minus 8.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x9a, 0x00, 0x43, 0x4f, 0x55, 0x4e, 0x54, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x6d
      ^     ^     ^_________________________________________^     ^
      |     |     |                                               checksum
      |     |     "COUNT\0\0\0"
      |     INFO_NAME
      MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_8 | MODE_2

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor with mode > 7:

    0x98, 0x20, 0x53, 0x50, 0x45, 0x43, 0x20, 0x31, 0x00, 0x00, 0x53
      ^     ^     ^_________________________________________^     ^
      |     |     |                                               checksum
      |     |     "SPEC 1\0\0"
      |     INFO_NAME | INFO_MODE_PLUS_8
      MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_8 | MODE_0

Newer I/O devices may also supply 6 bytes of information after the name. In this
case, the name will be 5 bytes or less, followed by a zero terminator and the
last 6 bytes will be the motor info.

Example, LEGO Technic Large Linear Motor:

    0xA0, 0x00, 0x50, 0x4F, 0x57, 0x45, 0x52, 0x00, 0x30, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x05, 0x04, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x31
      ^     ^     ^_____________________________^     ^_____________________________^     ^_________________^     ^
      |     |     "POWER\0"                           flags                               padding                 checksum
      |     INFO_NAME
      MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_16 | MODE_0

Flags are as follows (? means bit has been seen but function is unknown):

| Byte | Bit | Description                      |
|------|-----|----------------------------------|
| 0    | 7   | requires constant power on pin 2 |

| 5    | 0   |                                  |

#### INFO_RAW

`INFO_RAW` provides information about the scaling of the raw sensor value for a
mode. This information should be disregarded since UART devices always send
scaled data values. This message is optional. If omitted, the min and max values
are assumed to be 0.0 and 1023.0.

This message is formatted as follows:

    MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_8 | MODE_<m>, INFO_RAW [| INFO_MODE_PLUS_8], <min>, <max>, <checksum>

`<min>` and `<max>` are 32-bit little-endian IEEE 754 floating point values.

The mode `<m>` is limited to 7. If the mode is greater than 7, `INFO_MODE_PLUS_8`
must be set in the second byte of the message and `<m>` must be set to the mode
minus 8.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x9a, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xc8, 0x42, 0xee
      ^     ^     ^_________________^    ^_________________^      ^
      |     |     |                      |                        checksum
      |     |     |                      max = 100.0
      |     |     min = 0.0
      |     INFO_RAW
      MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_8 | MODE_2

#### INFO_PCT

`INFO_PCT` provides information on scaling the sensor value for a mode to a
percentage. Basically, this is either going to be 0 to 100% or -100% to 100%.
This message is optional. If omitted, the values are assumed to be 0.0 and 100.0.

This message is formatted as follows:

    MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_8 | MODE_<m>, INFO_PCT [| INFO_MODE_PLUS_8], <min>, <max>, <checksum>

`<min>` and `<max>` are 32-bit little-endian IEEE 754 floating point values.

The mode `<m>` is limited to 7. If the mode is greater than 7, `INFO_MODE_PLUS_8`
must be set in the second byte of the message and `<m>` must be set to the mode
minus 8.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x9a, 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xc8, 0x42, 0xed
      ^     ^     ^_________________^    ^_________________^      ^
      |     |     |                      |                        checksum
      |     |     |                      max = 100.0
      |     |     min = 0.0
      |     INFO_PCT
      MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_8 | MODE_2

#### INFO_SI

`INFO_SI` provides information on the scaled data value for a mode. For some
sensors, this may be the min and max possible values. For other sensors without
such bounds, the max value may indicate, for example, one rotation of a motor
(360.0). This message is optional. If omitted, the values are assumed to be 0.0
and 1023.0.

This message is formatted as follows:

    MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_8 | MODE_<m>, INFO_SI [| INFO_MODE_PLUS_8], <min>, <max>, <checksum>

`<min>` and `<max>` are 32-bit little-endian IEEE 754 floating point values.

The mode `<m>` is limited to 7. If the mode is greater than 7, `INFO_MODE_PLUS_8`
must be set in the second byte of the message and `<m>` must be set to the mode
minus 8.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x9a, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0xc8, 0x42, 0xec
      ^     ^     ^_________________^    ^_________________^      ^
      |     |     |                      |                        checksum
      |     |     |                      max = 100.0
      |     |     min = 0.0
      |     INFO_SI
      MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_8 | MODE_2

#### INFO_UNITS

`INFO_UNITS` provide a string giving the units of measurement for a mode. The
value is limited to 4 characters (not including the null terminator). This
message is optional. If omitted, it is assumed to be an empty string.

This message is formatted as follows:

    MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_<n> | MODE_<m>, INFO_UNITS [| INFO_MODE_PLUS_8], <unit>, <checksum>

`<unit>` is the units of measurement encoded using ASCII characters. The
length `<n>` must be a power of 2, so unused data bytes should be set to `0x00`.
The data does not need to include a null terminator, e.g. if the name is 4
characters, the length can be set to 4.

The mode `<m>` is limited to 7. If the mode is greater than 7, `INFO_MODE_PLUS_8`
must be set in the second byte of the message and `<m>` must be set to the mode
minus 8.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x92, 0x04, 0x43, 0x4e, 0x54, 0x00, 0x30
      ^     ^     ^_________________^    ^
      |     |     |                      checksum
      |     |     unit = "CNT\0"
      |     INFO_UNITS
      MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_4 | MODE_2

Note: The EV3 sources header files use the name `INFO_SYMBOL` instead of
`INFO_UNITS` for this feature.

#### INFO_MAPPING

`INFO_MAPPING` provides mode mapping information for Powered Up devices. This
message is omitted on EV3 sensors.

The message is formatted as follows::

    MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_2 | MODE_<m>, INFO_MAPPING [| INFO_MODE_PLUS_8], <input>, <output>, <checksum>

`<input>` and `<output>` are 8-bit flags.

| Bit | Description                      |
|-----|----------------------------------|
| 7   | Supports NULL value              |
| 6   | Supports Functional Mapping 2.0+ |
| 5   | N/A                              |
| 4   | ABS (Absolute [min..max])        |
| 3   | REL (Relative [-1..1])           |
| 2   | DIS (Discrete [0, 1, 2, 3])      |
| 1   | N/A                              |
| 0   | N/A                              |

The mode `<m>` is limited to 7. If the mode is greater than 7, `INFO_MODE_PLUS_8`
must be set in the second byte of the message and `<m>` must be set to the mode
minus 8.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x8a, 0x05, 0x08, 0x00, 0x78
      ^     ^     ^     ^     ^

#### INFO_MODE_COMBOS

`INFO_MODE_COMBOS` provides mode combination information for Powered Up devices.
This message appears after the `INFO_FORMAT` message on mode 0 only, making it
more akin to `CMD_...` instead of `INFO_...`. This message is omitted on EV3
sensors.

The data values 16-bit flags with each bit representing a mode. The number of
data values will depend on the device. If the number of data values does not
fit the length (since length can  only be power of 2), then zero values will
be added to pad the remaining length. There is a limit of 8 mode combination
values since messages are limited to 32 bytes.

The message is formatted as follows:

    MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_<l> | MODE_8, INFO_MODE_COMBOS, <data0>, [<data1>, [...] ], <checksum>

`<data1>` and `<data2>` are unknown 8-bit values.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x88, 0x06, 0x4f, 0x00, 0x3e
      ^     ^     ^_____^     ^
      |     |     |           checksum
      |     |     combos[0] = 0x004f (modes 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6)
      |     INFO_MODE_COMBOS
      MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_2 | MODE_0

#### INFO_FORMAT

`INFO_FORMAT` provide information about the data format and presentation for a
mode. This mode is required and must be the last `INFO_...` message for a mode.

This message is formatted as follows:

    MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_4 | MODE_<m>, INFO_FORMAT [| INFO_MODE_PLUS_8], <data-sets>, <format>, <figures>, <decimals>, <checksum>

`<data-sets>` is the number of sensor data values for this mode. `<format>` is
the data format (one of `DATAx`). `<data-sets>` times the size of `<format>`
must not exceed 32-byte. For example 32 8-bit values are allowed, but only 8
32-bit values are allowed. `<figures>` is the number of characters, including
the decimal point, to be displayed. `<decimals>` is the number of digits after
the decimal point. When `<format>` is an integer type and `<decimals>` is
non-zero, this implies a fixed point number. For example, if `<decimals>` is 1
and `<format>` is `DATA16`, then the actual sensor data value is the integer
value divided by 10.

The mode `<m>` is limited to 7. If the mode is greater than 7, `INFO_MODE_PLUS_8`
must be set in the second byte of the message and `<m>` must be set to the mode
minus 8.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

    0x92, 0x80, 0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x00, 0x30
      ^     ^     ^     ^     ^     ^     ^
      |     |     |     |     |     |     checksum
      |     |     |     |     |     decimals = 0
      |     |     |     |     figures = 4
      |     |     |     format = DATA32
      |     |     data-sets = 1
      |     INFO_FORMAT
      MESSAGE_INFO | LENGTH_4 | MODE_2

### Data Messages

Data messages (`MESSAGE_DATA`) are sent from the device to the brick after the
synchronization process has been complete (when brick sends ACK to device after
parsing info messages). Messages are sent whenever the device has new sensor
info or in response to a NACK (keep-alive) message from the brick.

LPF2 devices also have the ability to write data to the device for modes that
support it, for example, controlling the color of the light on a color sensor.

#### MESSAGE_DATA

This message is formatted as follows:

    MESSAGE_DATA | LENGTH_<n> | MODE_<m>, <data>, <checksum>

The size and format of `<data>` determined by the `<data-sets>` and `<format>`
values returned in the `INFO_FORMAT` message. `<n>` is the length of `<data>` in
bytes. Since `<n>` must be a power of 2, there may be some extra bytes in
`<data>` that should be ignored.

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

     0xC0, 0x00, 0x3f
      |     |     |
      |     |     checksum
      |     color index = 0
      MESSAGE_DATA | LENGTH_1 | MODE_0

#### Writing Data

LPF2 sensors have the added capability of being able to write formatted data
to a specific mode of the sensor. The format is the same as the one for data
received. The messages are actually two combined message to account for the
extended mode on LPF2 devices. The first message has the format:

    MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_1 | CMD_EXT_MODE, EXT_MODE_<m>, <checksum>

`<m>` is either 0 or 8 and will be added to the mode in the `MESSAGE_DATA`
message to get the actual mode.

The second message has the same format as data messages that are received from
the device (see previous section for details):

    MESSAGE_DATA | LENGTH_<n> | MODE_<m>, <data>, <checksum>

Example, LEGO BOOST Color and Distance sensor:

     0x46, 0x00, 0xb9, 0xC5, 0x00, 0x3a
      ^     ^     ^     ^     ^     ^
      |     |     |     |     |     checksum
      |     |     |     |     color index = 0
      |     |     |     MESSAGE_DATA | LENGTH_1 | MODE_5
      |     |     checksum
      |     EXT_MODE_0
      MESSAGE_CMD | LENGTH_1 | CMD_EXT_MODE
